# Principle of Programming with Javascript. 

#### Introducing Programming Languages
- Evolution of PL
- Types of programming languages and difference.
- Javascript as a programming language: History, and use cases
#### Javascript Language Basics
- Data types and Abstract data types.
    - Number
    - String
    - Boolean
    - Null
    - Undefined
- Variable and Scope
- Type Coercion: Implicit and Explicit Coercion
- Operators and Expression
- Flow Control
    - if statement,
    - if...else
    - if...elseif...else
    - Ternary Operator
- Loop and Iterations
    - while this...do that
    - do this...while that
    - for loop
    - Nesting Loops
    - Break and Continue statement
- **Exercise and Home Work**

#### Data Structures: Array and Object
- Brief Introduction of Object and OOP
- Of Two Ways to create an Object: Object literal and Object.create()
- Method and Property
- Revealing String Data Type as an Object
    - String Methods (str.length, str.indexOf, str.toUpperCase, str.slice, etc)
- Yet another Iteration: **for...of**
- The Math Object

#### Arrays
- What are Arrays?
- Two Ways of Defining an Array: Array Literal and Array Constructor
- Array Operations, Offsetting, and Traversal
- Mutability and Immutability
- Use Cases of Arrays

#### Functions
- What they are, and why we need them
- Defining Functions
- Arguments and Parameters: Behaviour in Javascript
- Pure and Impure Functions
- Hoisting, and IIFE
- Execution Context
- Closures
- Recursion
- But Functions are just like any other value in Javascript
- **Exercise**    

#### Higher Order Functions
- What do we mean?
- Functional Programming
- Built-in Array Methods
    - Filter
    - Map
    - forEach
    - Reduce
    - Every & Some
- **More Exercise**

#### Object Oriented Programming
- It's just a Paradigm. Concept of OOP
    - Abstraction
    - Encapsulation
    - Polymorphism
    - Inheritance
- Object literal, Method, and Property
- What is **this**?
- Tyepof and Instanceof Operators
- Using Function to generate Object: Factory Pattern
- Generating Objects with constructor Function
- Functions are Object, and are Function at the same time
    - The prototype property
    - Putting property on Functions
- Defining Object's prototype with ```Object.create```
- Class Notation: Statement and Expression form            
- Subclassing as Inheritance
- **Exercise**

#### Safety and Exceptions
- Bugs: what they are
- Dealing with Errors using ```try...catch```
- ```try...catch...finally``` statement
- The Error Object: Subclassing and Selective Catching
- Throwing Exceptions
- **Exercise**
