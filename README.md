### Installation
You will definitely need Node and NPM installed. When you have these two installed,
clone this repo, and **cd** into it, then run:
```npm
npm install
```
To install dev dependencies. After that, you can start a server (with live-reload) by running ```npm start``` or
run the build command ```npm run dev``` to "build" HTML (and assets) that would be viewed in your browser.

## Development
Making changes is easy, and should be done within the **src** folder. If you are running a viewing your work with ```npm start```
your changes will reflect immediately &mdash; otherwise, you'd have to run
```npm run build``` or ```npm run dev``` every time you make a change.

## Deployment
It's a static web page, we suggest instructors deploy unto [Netlify](http://netlify.com/). Set the Build command
to ```npm run build``` and the public folder to **public** (where the files will be served) when setting up on Netlify.

## Contribution
